                    The <strong>Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)</strong> is a
                    classic problem in the field of combinatorial optimization.
                    It asks a deceptively simple question:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <em>
                        Given a list of cities and the distances between each
                        pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that
                        visits each city exactly once and returns to the
                        starting city?
                    </em>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    While the problem seems easy to understand, solving it is
                    computationally challenging. The number of possible routes
                    grows <strong>factorially</strong> with the number of cities
                    â€” for just 10 cities, there are over{' '}
                    <code>3.6 million</code> possible routes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    TSP is not just a theoretical curiosity. It appears in many
                    real-world scenarios such as route planning, logistics, DNA
                    sequencing, and circuit design.
